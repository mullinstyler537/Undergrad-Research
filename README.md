This is a repository of all of my research projects I have worked on while studying bioinformatics
at Utah Tech University. I have been apart of a research group with chemistry and physics 
professors. I have learned to use an SEM to take microscopic images of animal hair and nanoparticles.
Currently I am working on writing a script to analyze the nanoparticles. The script will output
the size and amount of nanoparticles in the given image. 

*Feel free to check out my repo :)
